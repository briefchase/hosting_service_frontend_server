            <li>Account metadata (email, name) is retained as long as needed to operate the Service (e.g., subscription and support) and will be deleted upon request.</li>
            <li>You may request deletion of your account data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:briefchase@googlegroups.com">briefchase@googlegroups.com</a>. After verification, we will delete retained account data, except where retention is required by law.</li>
